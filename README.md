# Who is Fatima? 👩🏽‍💻💻
My name is Fatima and I have graduated from the University of Alberta Computer Science Program in 2019. In my last year of University, I attended a Hackathon with couple of my classmates and although we did not win, we were offered a contract by the City of Calgary to build our ETA Tool. The ETA tool allowed commuters estimate the travel impact in change of speed in residential areas. Also, in my last two years of University I had the pleasure of working with Camrose Boys and Girls Club first as a web developer and then as team lead developer. In this project we created a web app with a customized database for the client to make registration and collection of data easy.

In my recent role with Digital main street, I worked with over 20+ small to medium businesses to help develop their eCommerce store and assist them in sharing techniques that help maintain their store. Also prior to this role I worked as a web development freelance.
